### Research & Interests
- RNA-seq and transcriptomics
- Alternative splicing and microexons
- Single-cell analysis (Seurat)
- Workflow engineering (Nextflow, Snakemake, HPC)

---

### Selected Projects
- **RNA-seq Nextflow pipeline** – end-to-end processing with QC and reporting  
- **Microexon analysis** – PSI/LSV-based splicing discovery  
- **Single-cell workflows** – clustering, annotation, marker analysis
